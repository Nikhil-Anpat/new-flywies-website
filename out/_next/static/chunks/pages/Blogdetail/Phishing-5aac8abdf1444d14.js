Then a scammer uses the information to open new accounts, or invade the consumer’s existing accounts. tech support scammers want you to believe you have a serious problem with your computer, like a virus. They want you to pay for tech support services you don't need, to fix a problem that doesn’t exist. They often ask you to pay by wiring money, putting money on a gift card, prepaid card or cash reload card, or using a money transfer app because they know those types of payments can be hard to reverse. Tech support scammers may try to lure you with a pop-up window that appears on your computer screen. It might look like an error message from your operating system or antivirus software, and it might use logos from trusted companies or websites. the message in the window warns of a security issue on your computer and tells you to call a phone number to get help.

These updates could give you critical protection against security threats. the email says your account is on hold because of a billing problem. The email has a generic greeting, “Hi Dear.” If you have an account with the business, it probably wouldn’t use a generic greeting like this. The email invites you to click on a link to update your payment details. While, at a glance, this email might look real, it’s not. The scammers who send emails like this one do not have anything to do with the companies they pretend to be. Phishing emails can have real consequences for people who give scammers their information. And they can harm the reputation of the companies they’re spoofing. Your email spam filters may keep many phishing emails out of your inbox.
