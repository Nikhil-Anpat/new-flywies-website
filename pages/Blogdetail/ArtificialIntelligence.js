                <h3>Machine Learning Mastery</h3>

                <p>
                  A popular definition originates from Arthur Samuel in 1959:
                  machine learning is a subfield of computer science that
                  gives “computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
                  programmed.” In practice, this means developing computer
                  programs that can make predictions based on data. Just as
                  humans can learn from experience, so can computers, where data
                  experience.a machine learning workflow is the process required
                  for carrying out a machine learning project. Though individual
                  projects can differ, most workflows share several common
                  tasks: problem evaluation, data exploration, data
                  preprocessing, model training/testing/deployment, etc. The
                  ideal course introduces the entire process and provides
                  interactive examples, assignments, and/or quizzes where
                  students can perform each task themselvesIt is useful to tour
                  the main algorithms in the field to get a feeling of what
                  methods are available. There are so many algorithms that it
                  can feel overwhelming when algorithm names are thrown around
                  and you are expected to just know what they are and where they
                  fitI want to give you two ways to think about and categorize
                  the algorithms you may come across in the field. I want to
                  give you two ways to think about and categorize the algorithms
                  you may come across in the field. The second is a grouping of
                  algorithms by their similarity in form or function (like
                  grouping similar animals together). Both approaches are
                  useful, but we will focus in on the grouping of algorithms by
                  similarity and go on a tour of a variety of different
                  algorithm types. After reading this post, you will have a much
                  better understanding of the most popular machine learning
                  algorithms for supervised learning and how they are related.
                  There are different ways an algorithm can model a problem
                  based on its interaction with the experience or environment or
                  whatever we want to call the input data. It is popular in
                  machine learning and artificial intelligence textbooks to
                  first consider the learning styles that an algorithm can
                  adopt. There are only a few main learning styles or learning
                  models that an algorithm can have and we’ll go through them
                  here with a few examples of algorithms and problem types that
                  they suit. This taxonomy or way of organizing machine learning
                  algorithms is useful because it forces you to think about the
                  roles of the input data and the model preparation process and
                  select one that is the most appropriate for your problem in
                  order to get the best result. Input data is called training
                  data and has a known label or result such as spam/not-spam or
                  a stock price at a time. A model is prepared through a
                  training process in which it is required to make predictions
                  and is corrected when those predictions are wrong. The
                  training process continues until the model achieves a desired
                  level of accuracy on the training dataExample problems are
                  classification and regression.

                <h3>AI Trends</h3>
                <p>
                  The number of AI solutions that are being developed for IT
                  will increase in 2021. Capgemini’s Simion predicts that AI
                  solutions that can detect common IT problems on its own and
                  self-correct any small malfunctions or issues will see an
                  increase in the upcoming years. This will reduce downtime and
                  allow the teams in an organisation to work on high-complexity
                  projects and focus elsewhere. Rico Burnett, the director of
                  client innovation at legal services provider Exigent, says
                  that Artificial Intelligence will play a significant role in
                  the broad adoption of Cloud Solutions in 2021. Through the
                  deployment of artificial intelligence, it will be possible to
                  monitor and manage cloud resources and the vast amount of
                  available data. Over the last few years, the complexity of IT
                  systems has increased. Forrester recently said that vendors
                  would want platform solutions that combine more than one
                  monitoring discipline such as application, infrastructure, and
                  networking. IT operations and other teams can improve their
                  key processes, decision making, and tasks with AIOps solutions
                  and improved analysis of the volumes of data coming its way.
                  Forrester advised the IT leaders to find AIOps providers who
                  will empower the cross-team collaboration through end-to-end
                  digital experiences, data correlation, and integration of the
                  IT operations management toolchain.  In the future, we will
                  see more unstructured data is structured with natural language
                  processing and machine learning processes. Organisations will
                  leverage these technologies and create data that RPA or
                  robotic process automation technology can use when they want
                  to automate transactional activity in an organisation.  RPA is
                  one of the fastest-growing areas in the software industry. The
                  only limitation that it faces is that it can only use
                  structured data. With the help of AI, unstructured data can
                  easily be converted into structured data, which can provide a
                  defined output. We have seen continuous growth in adoption of
                  AI within the IT industry. However, Simion predicts that
                  organisations will use AI in production and start using them
                  at a large scale. With the help of artificial intelligence, an
                  organisation can get ROI in real-time. This means that
                  organisations will see their efforts being paid off. Natalie
                  Cartwright, co-founder and COO of Finn AI, an AI banking
                  platform, predicts that in 2021, organisations will deliver
                  expertise on how to leverage artificial intelligence against
                  major global problems, stimulate innovation and economic
                  growth, and ensure inclusion and diversity. As AI ethics
                  become more important to organisations, transparency of data
                  and algorithm fairness are two of the issues that are in the
                  spotlight.

                <h3>Open AI</h3>
                <p>
                  OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general
                  intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems
                  that outperform humans at most economically valuable
                  work—benefits all of humanity. We will attempt to directly
                  build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our
                  mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this
                  outcome. We commit to use any influence we obtain over AGI’s
                  deployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all, and to
                  avoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly
                  concentrate power.Our primary fiduciary duty is to humanity.
                  We anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to
                  fulfill our mission, but will always diligently act to
                  minimize conflicts of interest among our employees and
                  stakeholders that could compromise broad benefit.We are
                  committed to doing the research required to make AGI safe, and
                  to driving the broad adoption of such research across the
                  AI community. We are concerned about late-stage AGI
                  development becoming a competitive race without time for
                  adequate safety precautions. Therefore, if a value-aligned,
                  safety-conscious project comes close to building AGI before we
                  do, we commit to stop competing with and start assisting this
                  project. We will work out specifics in case-by-case
                  agreements, but a typical triggering condition might be “a
                  better-than-even chance of success in the next two years.” To
                  be effective at addressing AGI’s impact on society, OpenAI
                  must be on the cutting edge of AI capabilities—policy and
                  safety advocacy alone would be insufficient. We believe that
                  AI will have broad societal impact before AGI, and we’ll
                  strive to lead in those areas that are directly aligned with
                  our mission and expertise. We will actively cooperate with
                  other research and policy institutions; we seek to create a
                  global community working together to address AGI’s
                  global challenges. We are committed to providing public goods
                  that help society navigate the path to AGI. We have seen
                  continuous growth in adoption of AI within the IT industry.
                  However, Simion predicts that organisations will use AI in
                  production and start using them at a large scale. With the
                  help of artificial intelligence, an organisation can get ROI
                  in real-time. This means that organisations will see their
                  efforts being paid off.  Today this includes publishing most
                  of our AI research, but we expect that safety and security
                  concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future,
                  while increasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and
                  standards research.

                  2021. Data ecosystems are scalable, lean, and also provide
                  data on time to heterogeneous sources. However, it is
                  necessary to provide a foundation to adapt and foster
                  innovation. According to Ana Maloberti, a big data engineer at
                  Globant, companies will go a step further in optimising their
                  augmented business and development processes. Using Artificial
                  Intelligence, software development processes can be optimised,
                  and we can look for a wider collective intelligence and
                  improved collaboration. We must foster a data-driven culture
                  and grow out of the experimental stages to move into a
                  sustainable delivery model. A chatbot is an artificial
                  intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation
                  (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging
                  applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone.
                  Why are chatbots important? A chatbot is often described as
                  one of the most advanced and promising expressions of
                  interaction between humans and machines. However, from a
                  technological point of view, a chatbot only represents the
                  natural evolution of a Question Answering system leveraging
                  Natural Language Processing (NLP). Formulating responses to
                  questions in natural language is one of the most typical
                  Examples of Natural Language Processing applied in various
                  enterprises’ end-use applications. This process may look
                  simple; in practice, things are quite complex. Once the user’s
                  intent has been identified, the chatbot must provide the most
                  appropriate response for the user’s request. The answer may
                  be: Chatbot applications streamline interactions between
                  people and services, enhancing customer experience. At the
                  same time, they offer companies new opportunities to improve
                  the customers engagement process and operational efficiency by
                  reducing the typical cost of customer service. To be
                  successful, a chatbot solution should be able to effectively
                  perform both of these tasks. Human support plays a key role
                  here: Regardless of the kind of approach and the platform,
                  human intervention is crucial in configuring, training and
                  optimizing the chatbot system. There are different approaches
                  and tools that you can use to develop a chatbot. Depending on
                  the use case you want to address, some chatbot technologies
                  are more appropriate than others. In order to achieve the
                  desired results, the combination of different AI forms such as
                  natural language processing, machine learning and semantic
                  understanding may be the best option.

                  around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to
                  promote how their products and services use AI. Often what
                  they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as
                  machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized
                  hardware and software for writing and training machine
                  learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous
                  with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are
                  popular.In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts
                  of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations
                  and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions
                  about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed
                  examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges
                  with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to
                  identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions
                  of examples.programming focuses on three cognitive skills:
                  learning, reasoning and self-correction.This aspect of AI
                  programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for

                <p>
                  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been part of computing since
                  the 1950s. But it’s only been since 2000 that AI systems have
                  been able to accomplish useful tasks like classifying images
                  or understanding spoken language. And only very recently has
                  Machine Learning advanced to a point such that significant AI
                  computations can be performed on the smartphones and tablets
                  available to students. MIT is building tools into App Inventor
                  that will enable even beginning students to create original AI
                  applications that would have been advanced research a decade
                  ago. This creates new opportunities for students to explore
                  the possibilities of AI and empowers students as creators of
                  the digital future.AI with MIT App Inventor includes tutorial
                  lessons as well as suggestions for student explorations and
                  project work. Each unit also includes supplementary teaching
                  materials: lesson plans, slides, unit outlines, assessments
                  and alignment to the Computer Science Teachers of America
                  (CSTA) K12 Computing Standards. As with all MIT App Inventor
                  efforts, the emphasis is on active constructionist learning
                  where students create projects and programs that instantiate
                  their ideas.Machine learning is behind chatbots and predictive
                  text, language translation apps, the shows Netflix suggests to
                  you, and how your social media feeds are presented. It powers
                  autonomous vehicles and machines that can diagnose medical
                  conditions based on images. When companies today deploy
                  artificial intelligence programs, they are most likely using
                  machine learning — so much so that the terms are often used
                  interchangeably, and sometimes ambiguously. Machine learning
                  is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers
                  the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.“In
                  just the last five or 10 years, machine learning has become a
                  critical way, arguably the most important way, most parts of
                  AI are done,” said MIT Sloan professorThomas W. Malone, the
                  founding director of the MIT Center for Collective
                  Intelligence. “So that's why some people use the terms AI and
                  machine learning almost as synonymous … most of the current
                  advances in AI have involved machine learning.”Top of FormWith
                  the growing ubiquity of machine learning, everyone in business
                  is likely to encounter it and will need some working knowledge
                  about this field. A 2020 Deloitte survey found that 67% of
                  companies are using machine learning, and 97% are using or
                  planning to use it in the next year.From manufacturing to
                  retail and banking to bakeries, even legacy companies are
                  using machine learning to unlock new value or boost
                  efficiency. “Machine learning is changing, or will change,
                  every industry, and leaders need to understand the basic
                  principles, the potential, and the limitations,” said MIT
                  computer science professor Aleksander Madry, director of
                  the MIT Center for Deployable Machine Learning.While not
                  everyone needs to know the technical details, they should
                  understand what the technology does and what it can and cannot
                  do, Madry added. “I don’t think anyone can afford not to be
                  aware of what’s happening.”

                  Don’t be shy! We love to hear from readers and aspiring
                  writers. Chatbot technology is becoming a bigger part of our
                  lives as consumers and in business. Here’s how chatbots, with
                  the influence of AI, are shaking customer service up. What is
                  a chatbot? Companies use chatbots to engage with customers
                  alongside the classic customer service channels of phone,
                  email, and social media. Their popularity is on the rise:
                  service organizations have increased their adoption of
                  chatbots — often powered by artificial intelligence (AI) — by
                  nearly two-thirds since 2018. In the workplace, businesses
                  use chatbots to boost agent productivity and efficiency in a
                  range of ways. Chatbots quickly give service reps the
                  information they need, serving up relevant resources even as
                  the context of a conversation changes. Chatbots also speed up
                  self-service options for customers and resolve common issues
                  such as checking claims status, modifying orders, and more.
                  Technically speaking, a chatbot (derived from “chat robot”) is
                  a computer program that simulates human conversation, either
                  via voice or text communication. These programs can be
                  customized and used in a variety of ways. Most of us are
                  familiar with bots for customer service in our consumer lives,
                  and also with popular chat and messaging platforms like SMS,
                  Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and WeChat. With chatbots,
                  people can have a conversation with a person (a sales rep or a
                  support agent, for instance), or interact with a software
                  program that helps them find answers quickly. Most
                  importantly, a chatbot can influence a customer relationship
                  by responding to requests faster while meeting customer
                  expectations. With the potential for delivering instant
                  responses around the clock, chatbots free up customer support
                  teams to apply their emotional intelligence to more complex
                  queries. One of the earliest examples of a chatbot was
                  a program called ELIZA, built by Massachusetts Institute of
                  Technology professor Joseph Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s to
                  simulate a psychotherapist. Using keywords and pattern
                  matching, ELIZA responded to a user’s typed questions with
                  simple open-ended replies, based on a script. Later chatbot
                  models included SmarterChild, offered as part of the desktop
                  version of AOL Instant Messenger in the early 2000s.
                  SmarterChild was a rudimentary digital assistant, retrieving
                  requested information like movie showtimes and weather
                  reports.Over the years, developers have incorporated more
                  sophisticated techniques to enable chatbots to better
                  understand people’s questions and provide more useful
                  responses.While today’s bots still can’t handle all customer
                  queries, they can respond to frequently asked questions or
                  perform straightforward tasks.“Out of the pool of problems
                  your customers have, there are some that are best suited for a
                  talk with a human. But that’s not something as common as
                  ‘reset my password.’ Agents’ time is precious, so save them
                  for the complex stuff … Let the chatbot take care of the
                  simpler jobs,” wrote Greg Bennett, conversation design
                  principal at Salesforce./The simplest form of a chatbot system
                  tackles tasks by parsing customer input, then scans its
                  database for articles related to certain words and phrases. In
                  short, it operates like a document retrieval system based on
                  keywords. For example, a cosmetics company might create a bot
                  that engages users with questions about their makeup
                  preferences, then recommends products and offers that match
                  their responses.In these cases, the computer program behind
                  the chatbot works to a rigid set of predefined rules and has
                  little ability to recognize the way people naturally speak.
                  Think about the times you may have typed a question into a
                  website’s dialogue box and received an answer that didn’t make
                  sense. That’s likely because the chatbot program recognized
                  keywords in your request, but not the context in which they
                  were used.

                <p>
                  In the days of analog TV, cable boxes descrambled the premium
                  channels and managed the high channel numbers very early TVs
                  did not support. For today's digital service, the cable box
                  decodes MPEG video frames, decrypts the premium channels and
                  stores and displays the program guides. Also providing
                  upstream communications for video-on-demand, digital cable
                  boxes often have a built-in DVR for recording content on a
                  hard drive. Many cable TV companies also offer Internet
                  service, but their set-top boxes are only for TV. The cable
                  coming into the house is split into two lines: one to the
                  set-top box and the other to the cable modem for Internet
                  access. See MPEG, DVR, CableCARD, cable modem and hybrid
                  set-top box. The Motorola unit (top) connects to the cable
                  company's coaxial cable, whereas the Apple TV (only four
                  inches wide) gets its content via Ethernet or Wi-Fi. In
                  practice, today's streaming set-top boxes are often hidden in
                  the A/V cabinet and nothing much to look at. These three plug
                  into the A/V receiver via HDMI and connect to the home network
                  via the Ethernet switch. Older set-top boxes such as this Roku
                  unit had analog outputs to accommodate legacy TVs. However,
                  HDMI has pretty much replaced this variety of connectivity
                  (see HDMI).A device that converts video content to analog or
                  digital TV signals. For years, the set-top box (STB) was the
                  cable box that "sat on top" of the TV. Although no more flat
                  surface to rest anything, the term lives on. A satellite TV
                  set-top box is officially a "satellite receiver," and the box
                  that converts over-the-air digital broadcasts to analog for
                  old TVs is a "converter" (see TV converter box). Apple TV,
                  Fire TV, Android TV and Roku boxes connect to the home network
                  for Internet access and convert video from Netflix, Hulu and
                  other providers into TV signals. These "media hubs" go by many
                  names and may accept local content from the home network as
                  well (see digital media hub). n the past, set top boxes were
                  mostly used for cable and satellite television. The STB could
                  deliver more channels than a television's own channel
                  numbering system. It received signals containing data for
                  multiple channels and filtered out the channel a user wanted
                  to view. The numerous channels were generally transmitted to
                  an auxiliary channel on the television. Other features
                  included a decoder for pay-per-view and premium channels.
                  Today, most STB systems have two-way communication, allowing
                  for interactive features like adding premium channels directly
                  from the device or incorporating Internet access.

                  An international team of scientists identified the snake and
                  its range, which includes Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia,
                  Georgia, Iraq, Iran, and Russia including a small region
                  extending into the corner An enormous amount of gravity from a
                  cluster of distant galaxies causes space to curve so much that
                  light from them is bent and emanated our way from numerous
                  directions. This “gravitational lensing” effect has allowed
                  University of Copenhagen astronomers to observe the same
                  exploding star in three different places in the heavens. They
                  predict that a fourth image of the same explosion will appear
                  in the sky by 2037. The study, which has recently been
                  published in the journal Nature Astronomy, provides a unique
                  opportunity to explore not just the supernova itself, but the
                  expansion of our universe. One of the most fascinating aspects
                  of Einstein’s famed theory of relativity is that gravity is no
                  longer described as a force, but as a “curvature” of space
                  itself. The curvature of space caused by heavy objects does
                  not just cause planets to spin around stars, but can also bend
                  the orbit of light beams.The heaviest of all structures in the
                  universe — galaxy clusters made up of hundreds or thousands of
                  galaxies — can bend light from distant galaxies behind them so
                  much that they appear to be in a completely different place
                  than they actually are.But that’s not it: light can take
                  several paths around a galaxy cluster, making it possible for
                  us to get lucky and make two or more sightings of the same
                  galaxy in different places in the sky using a powerful
                  telescope.Some routes around a galaxy cluster are longer than
                  others, and therefore take more time. The slower the route,
                  the stronger the gravity; yet another astonishing consequence
                  of relativity. This staggers the amount of time needed for
                  light to reach us, and thereby the different images that we
                  see.This wondrous effect has allowed a team of astronomers at
                  the Cosmic Dawn Center — a basic research center run by the
                  Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and DTU
                  Space at the Technical University of Denmark — along with
                  their international partners, to observe a single galaxy in no
                  less than four different places in the sky.We know that the
                  universe is expanding, and that different methods allow us to
                  measure by how fast. The problem is that the various
                  measurement methods do not all produce the same result, even
                  when measurement uncertainties are taken into account. Could
                  our observational techniques be flawed, or — more
                  interestingly — will we need to revise our understandings of
                  fundamental physics and cosmology.

                  Every day, computer science researchers are working to solve
                  big problems that impact all of our lives — from expanding
                  accessibility in wearable technology to improving the lives of
                  rural farmers through AI. For CS research to explore issues
                  that impact all communities, it’s crucial that the researchers
                  themselves are representative of those communities. However,
                  in 2020, less than 10% of computer science Ph.D. degrees in
                  the United States were awarded to researchers from
                  historically marginalized groups in computing.Vision-language
                  modeling grounds language understanding in corresponding
                  visual inputs, which can be useful for the development of
                  important products and tools. For example, an image captioning
                  model generates natural language descriptions based on its
                  understanding of a given image. While there are various
                  challenges to such cross-modal work, significant progress has
                  been made in the past few years on vision-language modeling
                  thanks to the adoption of effective vision-language
                  pre-training (VLP). This approach aims to learn a
                  single feature space from both visual and language inputs,
                  rather than learning two separate feature spaces, one each for
                  visual inputs and another for language inputs. For this
                  purpose, existing VLP often leverages an object detector,
                  like Faster R-CNN, trained on labeled object detection
                  datasets to isolate regions-of-interest (ROI), and relies on
                  task-specific approaches (i.e., task-specific loss functions)
                  to learn representations of images and texts jointly. Such
                  approaches require annotated datasets or time to design
                  task-specific approaches, and so, are less scalable. To
                  address this challenge, in “SimVLM: Simple Visual Language
                  Model Pre-training with Weak Supervision”, we propose a
                  minimalist and effective VLP, named SimVLM, which stands for
                  “Simple Visual Language Model”. SimVLM is trained end-to-end
                  with a unified objective, similar to language modeling, on a
                  vast amount of weakly aligned image-text pairs (i.e., the text
                  paired with an image is not necessarily a precise description
                  of the image). The simplicity of SimVLM enables efficient
                  training on such a scaled dataset, which helps the model to
                  achieve state-of-the-art performance across six
                  vision-language benchmarks. Moreover, SimVLM learns a unified
                  multimodal representation that enables
                  strong zero-shot cross-modality transfer without fine-tuning
                  or with fine-tuning only on text data, including for tasks
                  such as open-ended visual question answering, image captioning
                  and multimodal translation.Unlike existing VLP methods that
                  adopt pre-training procedures similar to masked language
                  modeling (like in BERT), SimVLM adopts the
                  sequence-to-sequence framework and is trained with a one
                  prefix language model (PrefixLM) objective, which receives the
                  leading part of a sequence (the prefix) as inputs, then
                  predicts its continuation. For example, given the sequence “A
                  dog is chasing after a yellow ball”, the sequence is randomly
                  truncated to “A dog is chasing” as the prefix, and the model
                  will predict its continuation. The concept of a prefix
                  similarly applies to images, where an image is divided into a
                  number of “patches”, then a subset of those patches are
                  sequentially fed to the model as inputs—this is called an
                  “image patch sequence”. In SimVLM, for multimodal inputs
                  (e.g., images and their captions), the prefix is a
                  concatenation of both the image patch sequence and prefix text
                  sequence, received by the encoder. The decoder then predicts
                  the continuation of the textual sequence. Compared to prior
                  VLP models combining several pre-training losses, the PrefixLM
                  loss is the only training objective and significantly
                  simplifies the training process.
